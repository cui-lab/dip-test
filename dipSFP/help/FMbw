lambda0,outliers.ratio,m0: tuning parameters, see `Details' below. 

     tol: the desired accuracy (convergence tolerance) in computing the
          modified critical bandwidth by bisection method. 

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     Fisher and Marron (2001) proposed a modified critical bandwidth
     instead of Silverman critical bandwidth (1981) to estimate the
     underlying data distribution and generate bootstrap resamples in
     smooth bootstrap algorithm. Two tuning parameters `lambda0' and
     `m0' were used to deal with the outliers problems and distinguish
     minor or major modes. As suggested in Fisher and Marron (2001),
     `lambda0' can be given directly by user or determined by the ratio
     of outliers `outliers.ratio'. If both of them are given, then the
     maximum of `lambda0' and `outliers.ratio/h/(2*pi)^(1/2)' is used
     in computation, where `h' is the bandwidth at which the statistic
     S_k is calculated. The defaults of `lambda0' and `outliers.ratio'
     are both zero. The default of `m_0' is 0.003.
